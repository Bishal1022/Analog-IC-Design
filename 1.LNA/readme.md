# Cascode LNA
The given LNA is designed at 2.1GHz. I have uploaded the Schematic design snap and the results obtained using the same. 
## Results
      1. Noise Figure is as low as 507mdB(0.5dB)
      2. The gain is 13.25dB which is just adequate. (Trade-off done between noise matching and power matching)
      3. And other S parameter plots are uploded in repo. Which can be adjusted as per the requirement with the cost of trade off with other parameter. 
      
In this design I have done a trade off with Power(Input) match which can be descripted as:
